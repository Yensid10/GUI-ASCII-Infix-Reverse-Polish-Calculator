This is the final release for my Calculator Project, all commits/branches/tags&CandidateReleases as well as full developmental history can be found within this GitLab page. I would like to apologise for a dip in commits within a specific week, as I was ill for that portion of time. I hope the continued amount of significant commits help make up for this, as well as providing a finished product.
