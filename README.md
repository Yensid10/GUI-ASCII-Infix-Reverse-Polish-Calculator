This is the final release for my Calculator Project, all commits/branches/tags&CandidateReleases as well as full developmental history can be found within this GitLab page. I would like to apologise for a dip in commits within a specific week, as I was ill for that portion of time. I hope the continued amount of significant commits help make up for this, as well as providing a finished product.

(I also did not realise that I had to individually push tags or create a candidate release branch for each tag, I thought with a commit it would push my tag along with the other code changes I made, and that when that tag was pushed it would count as a candidate release, rather then needing to create a seperately updating branch. I'm aware of these issues at the end of my project, so I have pushed all the local tags I made, minus a v0.5 one I made on a previous broken laptop I had, and will create a candidate release branch with my final project within it)

{One last final note, whilst my maven commands run successfully to create my JavaDoc and Jar file, the jar file crashes whenever I open it, I don't know if this is due to a problem with my pom file interacting with maven/the project, but since it gives me a java error I'm not quite certain. I will create the jar file as well as the JavaDoc, but if problems persist in being able to get them to work, running the Calculator class within eclipse should run the whole program/display the calculator in GUI form, and changing the if statement to a "!=" instead of a "==" should result in the ASCII view being displayed, I'm sorry for the inconvenience for all of this but its the best way I can show the final result}
